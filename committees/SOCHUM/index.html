            <p class="agenda">Agenda: <i>"Ensuring the safety of asylum seekers"</i></p>

            <p>Every day, people are forced to flee their homes due to war, violence or persecution. Once someone
                crosses an International border, they have the right to “Seek Asylum” in order to obtain protection in
                the country where they have found refuge. Worldwide there are 32.5 million refugees. Refugees are people
                who have been able to obtain asylum which means that they have the right to stay and be protected like
                other citizens in their country of refuge. Before becoming refugees, they are asylum seekers and
                unfortunately there are many situations in the world where people are restricted from seeking asylum.
                Ensuring the safety and well-being of asylum seekers is a paramount commitment that transcends borders
                and speaks to the very essence of our shared humanity. Asylum seekers might face pushbacks at borders,
                discrimination, trafficking and arbitrary detention.</p>
            <p>In a world rife with challenges, it becomes our collective duty to establish robust systems that
                guarantee the protection of those seeking refuge from perilous circumstances. The SOCHUM recognizes the
                key factors to be "No pushback at borders", "No discrimination", "Safe access", "Humane treatment" and
                aims to ensure these issues are resolved through meaningful debate at the conference.</p>
